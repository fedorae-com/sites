    <p>Hi there,</p>
    <p>Sometimes you just want to send a simple <br>HTML email with a simple design and clear call <br> action. This is it.</p>
    <button class="button" style="" type="button" name="button"><strong>Call To Action</strong></button>
    <p>This is a really simple email template. It's sole purpose is to get the recipient to click the button with no distractions.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This is the first line</li>
      <li>This is the 2nd line</li>
      <li>This is the last line which is extra long so we can see how it wraps if it it indeed long enough</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>It's been a hard day's night, and i been <br> working like a dog</li>
      <li>It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log</li>
      <li>But when I get home to you I find the things that you do</li>
      <li>Will make me feel alright</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Good luck! Hope it works.</p>
